# python-linear-algebra

## Summary

python-linear-algebra is a repository I created to help me learn linear algebra foundations as well as have my own reference modules and reference materials. I am following along with a Udacity course while and implementing solutions as described, but I am aslo creating an alternate version of each solution using common python libaries that make use of liear algebra functions.

### Topics Included
* Vector Operations
* Magnitude and Direction of Vectors (Normalization)
* Dot Product and Angle Between
* Check if two vectors are parallel and orthogonal

## Dependencies

About half of the code in this repository will be created from scratch, the other half will make use of common python libraries used in math and science applications such as numpy and scipy.
